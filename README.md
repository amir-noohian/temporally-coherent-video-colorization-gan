# Temporally Coherent Video Colorization with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
 This repository contains the Python codes of the project "Temporally Coherent Video Colorization with GANs." In this project, temporally coherent video colorization the Dragon Ball Z Anime has been done with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The content of each part is as follows:
 ## first:
 In this part, only GAN loss function is used to train the model.
 ## second:
 In this part, GAN, Style, and L1 loss functions are used to train the model.
 ## third:
 In this part, in addition to GAN, Style, and L1 loss functions, Content loss function is used as well.
 ## final:
 In this part, Conditional-GAN is used to improve training.
 ## final_grey:
 In this part, instead of line arts, greyscale images are used.
 ## assessment:
 In this part, the performance of each model is measured by using FrÂ´echet inception distance (FID) metric.
